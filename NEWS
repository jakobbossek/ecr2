ecr 2.2.1
=========

Fixes

* Fixed warnings raised by r-devel versions
* Fixed typo in the docs of approximateRefSets yielding the function not being exported


ecr 2.2.0
=========

Fixes

* Fixed bug in mutPolynomial where parameter lower was sanity-checked twice and upper not at all
* Fixed some typos in function documentations
* Fixed bug in updateParetoArchive: optimization direction, e.g., minimize first, maximize second objective are now respected

Added

* More literature references in documentation

New features

* Performance assessment for stochastic multi-objective optimization algorithms (very powerful tool)
  * Flexible scatterplots in 2D and 3D
  * Function to calculate a set of unary and binary performance indicators for a set of problems and algorithms
  * Function to visualize indicator distrbutions
  * Functions to perform statistical tests and output results as well-formatted LaTeX tables
* Exported helper functions getNumberOfChildren, getNumberOfParentsNeededForMating and generatesMultipleChildren

ecr 2.1.1
=========

Fixes

* Fixed: bug in replaceMuCommaLambda if n.elite was not set by hand
* Fixed: selGreedy throws error if n.select is larger than the number of individuals passed (this led to hard-to-detect errors in (mu, lambda) strategies and white-box approach)

New Features

* Added terminator stopOnMaxTime

ecr 2.1.0
=========

New Features

* uniform crossover recombinator recUnifCrossover
* parameter log.stats for ecr function (possibility to define fitness statistics to be logged)
* logical log.pop argument for ecr function (should each population be saved in the logger?)
* possibility to store additional stuff in logger via 'extras'
* terminators stopOnEvals and stopOnOptY

ecr 2.0.0
=========

* First submission of ecr 2 to CRAN.
* Almost everything changed.
