\title{Register operators to control object.}
\usage{
registerECROperator(control, slot, fun, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{control}{[\code{ecr_control}]\cr
Control object.}

\item{slot}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Name of the field in the control object where to store the operator.}

\item{fun}{[\code{function}]\cr
Actual operator. In order to use the various helper functions of ecr one needs
to stick to a simple convention: The first argument of \code{function} should
be the individual to mutate, a list of individuals for recombination or a matrix
of fitness values for recombination. If one does not want to use the corresponding
helpers, e.g., \code{mutate}, the signature of the function does not matter. However,
in this case you are responsible to pass arguments correctly.}

\item{...}{[any]\cr
Further arguments for \code{fun}. These arguments are stored in the control object
and passed on to \code{fun}.}
}
\value{
[\code{ecr_control}]
}
\description{
In ecr the control object stores information on the fitness
function and serves as a storage for evolutionary components used by your evolutionary
algorithm. This function handles the registration process.
