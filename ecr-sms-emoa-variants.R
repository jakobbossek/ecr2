#'based on dominated hypervolume.‚Äù European Journal of Operational Research. 181 (2007): 1653-1669.

# NOTE: the parent selection is always random selection as this is not
# specified in the above paper. If you want something with more selection pressure
# you need to implement it yourself.

# This is also implemented in ecr::smsemoa, but I suggest to use it this way
