\title{Determine which points of a set are (non)dominated.}
\usage{
which.dominated(x)

which.nondominated(x)

isMaximallyDominated(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{matrix}]\cr
Numeric (n x d) matrix where n is the number of points and d is the number
of objectives.}
}
\value{
[\code{integer}]
}
\description{
Given a matrix with one point per column \code{which.dominated} returns the
column numbers of the dominated points and \code{which.nondominated} the column
numbers of the nondominated points. Function \code{isMaximallyDominated} returns
a logical vector with \code{TRUE} for each point which is located on the last
non-domination level.

  cars = mtcars[, c("mpg", "hp")]
  cars$hp = -cars$hp
