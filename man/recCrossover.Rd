\description{
The one-point crossover recombinator is defined for float and binary
representations. Given two real-valued/binary vectors of length n, the
selector samples a random position i between 1 and n-1. In the next step
it creates two children. The first part of the first child contains of the
subvector from position 1 to position i of the first parent, the second part
from position i+1 to n is taken from the second parent. The second child
is build analogously.
If the parents are list of real-valued/binary vectors, the procedure described
above is applied to each element of the list.
